                <p class="nav-content-description">France has a long and rich history dating back to the early Middle Ages. The country was once known
                    as Gaul, inhabited by Celtic tribes. In 51 BC, the region was conquered by the Roman Empire under
                    Julius Caesar. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Franks, a Germanic tribe, took control of the
                    region, and the Kingdom of France was formed.</p>
